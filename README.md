# Neustadt.fr

This is the entire Neustadt.fr website hosted on Neocities, accessible at :

- https://neustadt.fr and
- https://neustadt.neocities.org/

Everything is hand-coded like I used to late 90s and early 2000s (even the RSS feed).
No CMS, no template and no theme. Just pure HTML and CSS. 

Most animated GIFs are things I've found, mostly on Archive.org's [Gifcities.org](https://gifcities.org/) service. 

You can my collection of links, tools and things related to 90s/early 2000 web and tech culture on my [Retro Stuff](https://neustadt.fr/retro-stuff/) page. And you can even [sign my guestbook](https://users2.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&i=g26-37520-60) if you have comments or just want to say hello.

Have a nice day.
