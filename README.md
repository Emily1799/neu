# Neustadt.fr

This is the entire Neustadt.fr website hosted on Neocities, accessible at :

- https://neustadt.fr and
- https://neustadt.neocities.org/

Everything is hand-coded like I used to late 90s and early 2000s, so there's no CMS, no template and no theme. Just pure HTML and CSS.

Most animated GIFs are things I've found, mostly on Archive.org's [Gifcities.org](https://gifcities.org/) service. 

You can find more old-school stuff on my [Retro Stuff](https://neustadt.fr/retro-stuff/) page, and even [sign my guestbook](https://users2.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&i=g26-37520-60) if you have comments or just want to say hello.
