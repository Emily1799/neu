# Rediscovering the Small Web

*Most websites today are built like commercial products: made to draw the largest audience, optimised to generate engagement, designed by professionals or companies and "pushed" either via search engine optimisation or advertising. But there is also a smaller web that is a lot less visible, designed by regular people simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is quirky, creative and so much more fun than thevisible web.*

Every website redesign starts with inspiration. 

For this one, there were two. One was Anders' very [clean 10k website](anders.unix.se) and the other, a webpage I chanced upon called [Marijn's site](https://marijnflorence.neocities.org/index.html). The first one inspired me to make a well-structured, readable homepage. The second reminded me just how _fun_ the web can be.

Some of you might have read my previous article, [Against an Increasingly User Hostile Web](../against-a-user-hostile-web/). In it, I argued that we are replacing an open web that connects and empowers with one that restricts and commoditises people. I talked about how the modern web of surveillance, bloat and walled gardens is at odds with the open web that I fell in love with. Despite being two and a half years old, the article unfortunately still reflects the state of the web today.

But stumbling upon Marijn’s site gave me hope. It reminded me that the creative, personal, _fun_ web I grew up with is not a thing of the past at all. In 2020, it’s still here, you just have to know where to look.

This essay is my attempt to show you what the small and independent web can look like, why it’s different from the Big Web that dominates web traffic today, and how easy it is for anyone to be a part of it. Including you, if you want to.

This essay is somewhat long, so a table of contents might come handy:

## Retro Redesign

I’ll start by explaining how this new design was both the result and the source of my excitement for the small web.

In my homepage, I mention that this website is “a tribute to the creative web of the 90s”. I don’t say this simply because I have animated gifs and a guestbook:  I decided to hand-code the entire website in plain HTML and CSS. 

No content managing systems, no generators, no templates, no themes, no plugins. Just plain markup and styling, the basic building blocks of the web. 

I didn’t plan to do it like this; I previously used a static site generator to output plain HTML and was just working on a new design template for that. But my three-year-old site setup was now spewing error messages, telling me some dependencies had to be updated and that a plugin was no longer compatible. Since I was too lazy to want to fix any of that, I wondered if I couldn’t just do it all manually instead and save myself the trouble. So I did. And I’ll be honest, I haven’t had this much fun making a website since the late 90s and early 2000s, when I first started playing around with Microsoft Frontpage and Macromedia Dreamweaver. 

For a small one like mine with about 10 total pages and a laid-back update schedule (if I’m being generous), this approach has many obvious benefits: almost no dependencies, easy to maintain, reasonably future proof, easily portable, the possibility to have a different background on every page… but most important of all, so much fun to work on! I worked till six in the morning for two straight days, not because I couldn’t sleep but I didn’t want to stop. Admittedly, I spent about 30% of that time scouring GifCities.org and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/web/) for animated GIFs and tiled background.

Importantly, this redesign led me down the rabbit hole of fun, informative, independent websites that I’d like to tell you about.

## Masters and Explorers, Authors and Navigators

Let’s start, as we so often do, in the past. 

> When people were discovering the web, 
> Geocities, Homestead, Angelfire, Tripod, Freeservers.
> Imagery: going somewhere, exploring new places. Semantic “Netscape Navigator”, “Internet Explorer”, space or navigational imagery.

Most people who ran websites weren’t web professionals. They were regular people who just had something to share with the world. 

## Small vs. Big Web

> Traffic %
> Search and push, vs browse and “surf”

## The Web as a Creative Space

> User-centered = optimised for the user’s preferences. This one is me-centered; it’s my little corner of the web, where I express myself the way I want to. No need for for “engagement” or optimisations. It’s the difference between product and art.

Modern websites are often products — they are made and optimised to generate interest and “conversion”. This might be in the form of a purchase, a click, a share or a sign-up. The words, the colours, the message are usually tailored to these goals, much like packaging on products in the super market. 

The small web is different, it’s an expression of the author’s interests and personality. A painter wouldn’t add more red to her painting, or change the composition, because research shows that people would like it like that. It’s her creative vision; some people might like it, others might despise it. And that’s that.

The modern web is mostly product. Most sd

## Highlights from the Small Web

A list of really cool websites either from the past (Restorativland and Internet Archive), or present (Neocities and Wiby).

## Your Own Corner of the Web

In fact, if you wanted to create your own own little corner of the web and have fun doing so, there’s nothing stopping you. 

All you would need is to learn basic HTML and CSS, set up a site for free at Neocities.org and start playing. If you have zero experience, It might take you a while to get a hang of how to change text sizes, colours, link between pages and add images, but I think that’s part of the fun. It’s like learning how to paint, or sculpt — once you create your first piece, you’ll see how great if feels to have made from scratch and put it up on the web for the world to see.

You can always view the source of any public website to take inspiration and learn. Make sure you pick simple, basic ones; the modern web is full of bloated websites that make HTML unreadable.  This website, for example, only uses basic HTML and CSS and I invite you to play with the code to your heart’s extent. It’s all in the public domain, so you can even copy all of it and modify it (and you don’t have to credit me or even link back, it’s all free). 

And if you do make a website, I’d love to see it (and perhaps even add it on here): send me an email at felix@neustadt.fr or send me a tweet at @parimalsatyal.
